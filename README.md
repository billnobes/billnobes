# Hi, I’m Bill 👋

Over 25 years of experience as a developer and technologist, with a current focus on transitioning to **AI-first development** using tools like Claude-code to achieve significant productivity multiples.

I specialize in leading and mentoring agile, high-impact teams, with a strong emphasis on innovation and adaptability. For the past decade, my work has focused on **healthcare education and training in the RCM space**.

In parallel, I bring a deep background in the arts—as a musician, recording engineer, stage manager, and multimedia artist—which informs my creative, interdisciplinary approach to solving technical problems.
